The fragments are the sub-activity in android application which is light-weight as compared to activiy.

The fragments are used to build the dynamic UI's.
 
The greatest advantage of fragments is they just simplify the task of making UI for multiple screens.

An activity can have many number of fragments.

Multiple fragments can be combined to make a single activity.

Also the fragments can be reused in multiple activities.

There is also fragment life cycle similar to activity life cycle.

The fragment lifecycle depends entirely on activity lifecycle.

If the activity lifecycle is paused than the fragment lifecycle is also paused or if the activity lifecycle is destroyed than fragment lifecycle is also destroyed

If activity lifecycle is running then we can add or delete the fragment. 

There is a fragment stack which keeps the track of all the fragments.
