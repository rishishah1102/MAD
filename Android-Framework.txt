The android framework provides the classes and libraries which is used to create the android application. 

It provides an abstraction for hardware access and also helps in managing the user interface with application resources.

It also handles the tasks such as managing the device's software and hardware resources, handling user interactions and providing access to system level services such as location, connectivity etc.

Some of the key components of the Android framework include:
1-Activity Manager: This component is responsible for managing the lifecycle of Android activities, which are the building blocks of user interfaces in Android apps.
2-Content Providers: These components provide a interface for accessing and manipulating data stored on the device or on remote servers.
3-Resource Manager: This component manages the app's resources, such as images, layouts, and strings.
4-Notification Manager: This component provides a way for apps to display notifications to the user, such as when a new message is received or a reminder is due.
5-View System: The multiple set of views can be used to create user interface.

In addition to this core components, the framework also includes the range of libraries and API's such as 3D graphics, multimedia playback etc. that allow developers to build great apps.

Hence, this way the android frameworks helps the developers to build innovative and engaging apps for android devices.
