The DVM stands for Dalvik Virtual Machine.

The DVM was written by Dan BornStein.

The DVM is a virtual machine which is used for executing android applications on mobile devices.

The DVM is used rather than jvm because the dvm consumes less memory and is very fast i.e efficient

The DVM optimizes the virtual machine for memory, battery life and performance.

The Dex compiler converts the .class files into the .dex file that run on the Dalvik VM. 

Multiple .class files are converted into single .dex file.

Diagram -
.java files -> java compiler(javac) -> .class files -> Dex compiler(dx) -> .dex file -> android assets packaging tool (aapt) -> .apk file
the files would be in square box and the compiler will be oval shaped box.
