The android components are the building blocks of the android application.

These components are interconnected with android manifest file (AndroidManifest.xml) that describes each component of the application and how they interact.

There are four components of the android application :-
1- Activities: An activity is a collection of screen or it is just a simple UI. It handles the user interaction to the smart phone screen.

2- Services: This component handles the background process associated with the application.

3- Broadcast Receivers: This component handles the communication between Android OS and applications.

4- Content Providers: This component provides the interface for accessing and manipulating the data stored in user's device or remote servers.
