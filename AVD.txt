AVD stands for Android Virtual Device.

It is a software based emulation on android device that runs on the computer and allows developers to test the android application without the need for a physical device.

The developers can create multiple AVD's with different configuration such as different android versions, screen sizes and hardware specifications.

The developers can also create custom AVD's to test their application on variety of devices.

The avdmanager is a command line tool which allows the developers to create and manage the AVD's using command line.

If the developer is using the Android Studio than the developer do not need to use the avdmanager tool because the developer can create and manage the AVD's from IDE only.

It is an official integrated development environment for android app development.
